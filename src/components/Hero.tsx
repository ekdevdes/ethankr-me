          As a seasoned engineer with over ten years of experience, I thrive on
          owning every part of the system, from front-end to back-end, as well
          as the infrastructure with Terraform and Amazon Web Services (AWS). I
          firmly believe that software engineering is a team sport. It's not
          only about building the most technically robust solution, but
          collaborating with a team of individuals, each highly skilled in their
          own areas, to craft the best solutions for customers. After all, in
          the end, the best technology isn’t just about technical excellence —
          it’s about creating something that seamlessly enhances people’s lives,
          allowing them to focus on what truly matters: living life, making
          memories and being present for the moments that matter.
