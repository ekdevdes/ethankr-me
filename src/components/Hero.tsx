          As a seasoned engineer with over ten years of experience, I thrive on
          owning every part of the system, from front-end to back-end, as well
          as the infrastructure with Terraform and AWS (Amazon Web Services). I
          firmly believe that software engineering is a team sport. It's not
          only about building the most technically robust solution, but
          collaborating with a team of individuals, each highly skilled in their
          own areas, to craft the best solutions for customers. Because in the
          end, the best technology isn‚Äôt just about technical excellence ‚Äî it‚Äôs
          about creating something that seamlessly enhances people‚Äôs lives,
          allowing them to focus on what truly matters: living life, making
          memories and being present for the moments that matter.
